### **Prerequisites**

To use Nora, all you need is:

* **An Account**: Create your Nora account by signing up at [fromnora.com](https://fromnora.com).

* **A Domain**: Use your business domain (e.g., website.com) for email forwarding. Nora will handle customer inquiries sent to addresses like [support@website.com]().

### **Onboarding Process**

Nora v0.1 simplifies the onboarding process into five steps:

1. **Sign Up & Subscribe**
   After creating your account, you’ll be prompted to choose a plan. A subscription is required to access Nora’s features.

2. **Business Information**
   Enter key details:

   * Your name

   * Business name

   * Website URL

   * Industry

3. **Add Knowledge Sources**
   Teach Nora about your business by uploading resources:

   * **PDFs**: Upload policy documents, FAQs, or other resources Nora can learn from. Ensure the text in your PDFs can be highlighted to make it readable.

   * **Links**: Paste URLs to pages you want Nora to analyze, such as your FAQ page or product descriptions.

     Nora will confirm successful training by listing these resources in her knowledge table. If you don’t have resources ready, you can skip this step and add them later.

4. **Email Forwarding Setup**
   Set up email forwarding from your provider to Nora. Follow the step-by-step instructions. For assistance, contact support at [nora@fromnora.com](mailto:nora@fromnora.com).
