Nora’s Inbox is your hub for managing customer inquiries.

* **Open Tab**: Emails that Nora isn’t confident about (yet) will appear here. Review her draft responses, approve or edit them, and resolve the ticket.

* **Done Tab**: Resolved tickets are moved here for your future reference.

Access the Inbox at [inbox.fromnora.com/inbox](https://inbox.fromnora.com/inbox).

#### **Knowledge Settings**

* **Personality Customization**
  Adjust Nora’s tone and behavior with custom instructions. Want her to sound like an Aussie or use industry-specific jargon? Tailor her responses here.
